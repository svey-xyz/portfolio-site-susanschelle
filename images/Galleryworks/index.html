<h2 align="center"><b>Information for New Web Accounts</b></h2>
<p>Welcome to the start page for new web accounts on www.ryerson.ca. This page 
  provides you with general information about your account and help to 
  get you started in developing your web site. Please read through for Ryerson specific 
  setup options.</p>
<p><b>Accessing your Account:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The current URL or address for your site is<b> http://www.ryerson.ca/~accountname</b> 
  For department or research accounts you can request an alias to remove the tilde(~) 
  from the address and extend the accountname to be more descriptive. Please 
  contact the CCS Help desk at extension 6806 for this. The alias option is NOT 
  available for personal accounts.</li>
  <li>Connect to the <strong>www.ryerson.ca</strong> server to place your Web files online or to check on the status of your account.
    <ul>
      <li>To upload your Web files, use Ftp(File 
      Transfer Protocol) or a Web page development package such as Dreamweaver.</li>
      <li>To
change your account password, use SSH software to connect to
www.ryerson.ca and login. Select option 1 to change your password.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each account is allocated a storage space quota. When you reach the quota, your account 
        locks which prevents any further updates. If you are uploading large files, 
    check your space usage. Use SSH to connect to www.ryerson.ca and your quota is displayed on the main screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Web Account File Structure:<i><br>
  <br>
  </i></b>When creating your web site there are a few points to keep in mind. 
  Your web account has a directory called<b> public_html</b>. All files to be 
  used on your web pages should be placed in this directory. The first file you 
  need to create is the<b> index.html</b> file which is the file you are currently 
  viewing on your new account. The index.html is 
  the default page displayed in any directory. When creating a new directory on 
  your account make sure to create an index.html. If you remove the index.html 
all your files will be listed when the directory is accessed by a web browser.</p>
